## Binary Tree Traversal

In computer science, binary trees allow for fun and exciting possibilities for the data that we use on a daily basis. Binary tree's leverage the power of logarithms to allow for very fast retrieval of data even when there are billions of records to go through. By continually halving the amount of data to look through, you'll very quickly find what you're looking for.

Finding a single node is straight forward with this structure, but what about when you have to get all the nodes out of your fancy array of nodes? In this case there are a few approaches you can take.

### In order Traversal

This method of tree traversal returns the data back to you in sorted order. The nice thing about trees is that it is built with relationships between your data already in mind. 

Starting at the root you want to compare left and right nodes and move to the one with the lowest value. This continues until you hit a leaf. This
